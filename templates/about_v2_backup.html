      <h1>About the Caretaker</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>I am Wajahat Hassan</strong>. I actually started out in
        Electrical Engineering. I spent a long time in that field, getting my
        Bachelor's and then my Master's. To be honest, I eventually realized
        that hardware wasn't really for me, but getting through those degrees
        taught me the most valuable thing I know:
        <strong>how to think like an engineer</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to be patient and how to break down big, scary problems
        into small, logical steps. Today, I use that same 'engineer's mind' when
        I'm <strong>coding in Python</strong>. I didn't leave my past behind; I
        just switched my toolkit from circuits to code to work on something I
        actually love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, my career took a bit of a turn. I helped start SparkE Production,
        a small 3D animation company, along with four of my relatives. We didn't
        really have a boss. It was just the five of us trying to figure
        everything out together. I ended up doing a little bit of everything -
        from talking to clients on Fiverr to keeping track of deadlines and
        solving whatever technical problems came up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with tools like Unreal Engine and Blender taught me that design
        is actually a lot like programming. I spent a lot of time fixing
        crashes, organizing files, and making sure we delivered good work on
        time. It made me realize that whether I'm building a 3D scene or a
        Python app, it's really about the same thing: having a good structure,
        using logic, and solving puzzles to make something cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might notice I already have a Master's in Electrical Engineering.
        So, why go for another one? It's actually pretty simple:
        <strong>I want to specialize</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background in engineering taught me how to work hard and how to solve
        difficult problems. But, I want to build software. And to do that the
        right way, I feel like I need the specific tools that you only get from
        a Computer Science degree. I don't really see this as starting over.
        It's more like, I have the foundation, but I need to go back and get
        that final piece so I can actually build the things I want to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, my goal is to <strong>build my future in South Korea</strong>,
        specifically around Asan and its neighboring cities. You might be
        wondering, why there?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I already have a pretty strong connection to the area. My wife is
        currently a GKS scholar at a university in this region. Through her,
        I've seen firsthand that this whole area is a really unique mix of
        traditional history and massive high-tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, it just feels like the perfect environment for me to
        <strong>combine my engineering background with software</strong>. And
        personally, having my family within reaching distance would give me the
        stability and support system I need. It would mean I could stop worrying
        about the distance and just fully focus on doing my best work in the
        Master's program.
