      <h1>About the Caretaker</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>I am Wajahat Hassan</strong>. I actually started out in
        Electrical Engineering. I spent a long time in that field, getting my
        Bachelor's and then my Master's. To be honest, I eventually realized
        that hardware wasn't really for me, but getting through those degrees
        taught me the most valuable thing I know:
        <strong>how to think like an engineer</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to be patient and how to break down big, scary problems
        into small, logical steps. Today, I use that same 'engineer's mind' when
        I'm <strong>coding in Python</strong>. I didn't leave my past behind; I
        just switched my toolkit from circuits to code to work on something I
        actually love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, my career took a bit of a turn. I helped start SparkE Production,
        a small 3D animation company, along with four of my relatives. We didn't
        really have a boss. It was just the five of us trying to figure
        everything out together. I ended up doing a little bit of everything -
        from talking to clients on Fiverr to keeping track of deadlines and
        <strong>solving whatever technical problems came up</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with tools like Unreal Engine and Blender taught me that design
        is actually a lot like programming. I spent a lot of time fixing
        crashes, organizing files, and making sure we delivered good work on
        time. It made me realize that whether I'm building a 3D scene or a
        Python app, it's really about the same thing: having a good structure,
        using logic, and solving puzzles to make something cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why I Built "The Shrine"</strong><br />I built this application
        because I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle a full software
        system. I used <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> for
        the backend, <strong>SQLite</strong> to manage data, and even integrated
        <strong>Google's AI</strong> to make the "Wisdom" feature work.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't easy. I had to learn how to handle asynchronous data (so the
        page doesn't reload every time you click) and how to organize my code
        using Object-Oriented Programming so it didn't turn into a mess. This
        project is my way of showing that I have the foundation to do this work
        professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Future in South Korea</strong><br />Now, my goal is to
        <strong>build my future in South Korea</strong>, specifically around
        Asan and its neighboring cities. You might be wondering, why there?
        Well, I already have a pretty strong connection to the area. My wife is
        currently a GKS scholar at a university in this region. Through her,
        I've seen firsthand that this whole area is a really unique mix of
        traditional history and massive high-tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science or working as a
        developer, being in this environment gives me the stability and support
        system I need to do my best work. I have the discipline from my
        Engineering background, and I have the drive from teaching myself to
        code. Now, I am just looking for the right place to apply it.
      </p>
